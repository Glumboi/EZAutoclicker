This changelog only goes from 1.6 till the latest version due to the lack of documentation i did.
Also since 1.6 i was offline for about 2 weeks so the versions from 1.7 - 2.2 are not downloadable anywhere.

Developed by:

Also feel free to look into my other projects on github OR nexusmods (same name as here) where i do mods for mainly PCBS (pc building simulator)


V 1.6:

-Optimized the code

-Added a feature that changes the app icon when the auto clicker is on or off

V 1.7:

-Made a few more optimization to the code

V 1.8:

-Made minimal changes to the UI
-Tried a new clicking system which resulted into a little "memory leak"

V 1.9:

-Fixed a little "memory leak" that happened in 1.8 and reverted to the old click system

V 2.0:

-Made a UI overall which includes groupboxes, bigger buttons and a more modern look

V 2.1:

-Added more comments in the project files to document my decissions and to help other devs if they want to do something with the source code

V 2.2:

-Minor adjustments to the UI

V 2.3:

-Biggest update in terms of features since the rightclick update (V 1.5)

-Added middleclick 

-Added a log feature which currently just makes a log that puts out basic info about the version of the app 
(optional it does not create logs when you dont want it, you have to press the "Create info log" button to create one it saves the log to the apps location btw)

-Added a feature that detects if you did not enter a number which shouldve been there since V 1.0 but i did not made it for some reason

V 2.5:

-Another big update in this version the only thing i made is another GUI redesign

V 2.6:

-Obfuscated the executable to compress the size by a bit and boost peformance

-Added a version checker which should detect if you run an outdated version of the app

-Made some little changes to the GUI

V 2.6.1:

-Added a feature that stops the timer when the click is off to reduce idle performance cost


Goal of V 3.0 will be:

-I was thinking of adding a "custom hotkey" feature which will grab your input and use it as hotkey so you can change it to your preference

-Improve ram usage a bit, the current version has a little bug where the ram usage ramps up (when using values lower than 1000) 
till a certain point basically a memory leak 
but it doesnt go higher than 289 mb so far
